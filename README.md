# Headscale

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/headscale-dev/community](https://badges.gitter.im/headscale-dev/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/headscale-dev/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

An open source implementation of the Tailscale coordination server.

## Overview

Tailscale is [a modern VPN](https://tailscale.com/) built on top of [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/). It [works like an overlay network](https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/) between the computers of your networks - using all kinds of [NAT traversal sorcery](https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/). 

Everything in Tailscale is Open Source, except the GUI clients for proprietary OS (Windows and macOS/iOS), and the 'coordination/control server'. 

The control server works as an exchange point of cryptographic public keys for the nodes in the Tailscale network. It also assigns the IP addresses of the clients, creates the boundaries between each user, enables sharing machines between users, and exposes the advertised routes of your nodes.

Headscale implements this coordination server.

## Status

- [x] Basic functionality (nodes can communicate with each other)
- [x] Node registration through the web flow
- [x] Network changes are relied to the nodes
- [x] ~~Multiuser~~ Namespace support
- [x] Basic routing (advertise & accept) 
- [ ] Share nodes between ~~users~~ namespaces
- [x] Node registration via pre-auth keys
- [ ] ACLs
- [ ] DNS

... and probably lots of stuff missing

## Roadmap ðŸ¤·

Basic multiuser support (multinamespace, actually) is now implemented. No node sharing or ACLs between namespaces yet though...

Suggestions/PRs welcomed!



## Running it

1. Compile the headscale binary
  ```shell
  make
  ```
  
2. Get yourself a PostgreSQL DB running (yes, [I know](https://tailscale.com/blog/an-unlikely-database-migration/))

  ```shell 
  docker run --name headscale -e POSTGRES_DB=headscale -e \
    POSTGRES_USER=foo -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=bar -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
  ```

3. Set some stuff up (headscale Wireguard keys & the config.json file)
  ```shell
  wg genkey > private.key
  wg pubkey < private.key > public.key  # not needed 
  cp config.json.example config.json
  ```

4. Create a namespace (equivalent to a user in tailscale.com)
  ```shell
  ./headscale namespace create myfirstnamespace
  ```

5. Run the server
  ```shell
  ./headscale serve
  ```
  
6. Add your first machine
  ```shell
  tailscale up -login-server YOUR_HEADSCALE_URL
  ```

7. Navigate to the URL you will get with `tailscale up`, where you'll find your machine key.

8. In the server, register your machine to a namespace with the CLI
  ```shell
  ./headscale -n myfirstnamespace node register YOURMACHINEKEY
  ```

## Configuration reference

Headscale's configuration file is named `config.json` or `config.yaml`. Headscale will look for it in `/etc/headscale`, `~/.headscale` and finally the directory from where the Headscale binary is executed.

```
    "server_url": "http://192.168.1.12:8000",
    "listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:8000",
```

`server_url` is the external URL via which Headscale is reachable. `listen_addr` is the IP address and port the Headscale program should listen on.

```
    "private_key_path": "private.key",
```

`private_key_path` is the path to the Wireguard private key. If the path is relative, it will be interpreted as relative to the directory the configuration file was read from.

```
    "derp_map_path": "derp.yaml",
```

`derp_map_path` is the path to the [DERP](https://pkg.go.dev/tailscale.com/derp) map file. If the path is relative, it will be interpreted as relative to the directory the configuration file was read from.

```
    "db_host": "localhost",
    "db_port": 5432,
    "db_name": "headscale",
    "db_user": "foo",
    "db_pass": "bar",
```

The fields starting with `db_` are used for the PostgreSQL connection information.

### Running the service via TLS (optional)

```
    "tls_cert_path": ""
    "tls_key_path": ""
```

Headscale can be configured to expose its web service via TLS. To configure the certificate and key file manually, set the `tls_cert_path` and `tls_cert_path` configuration parameters. If the path is relative, it will be interpreted as relative to the directory the configuration file was read from.

```
    "tls_letsencrypt_hostname": "",
    "tls_letsencrypt_cache_dir": ".cache",
    "tls_letsencrypt_challenge_type": "HTTP-01",
```

To get a certificate automatically via [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), set `tls_letsencrypt_hostname` to the desired certificate hostname. This name must resolve to the IP address(es) Headscale is reachable on (i.e., it must correspond to the `server_url` configuration parameter). The certificate and Let's Encrypt account credentials will be stored in the directory configured in `tls_letsencrypt_cache_dir`. If the path is relative, it will be interpreted as relative to the directory the configuration file was read from. The certificate will automatically be renewed as needed. The default challenge type HTTP-01 requires that Headscale listens on port 80 for the Let's Encrypt automated validation, in addition to whatever port is configured in `listen_addr`. Alternatively, `tls_letsencrypt_challenge_type` can be set to `TLS-ALPN-01`. In this configuration, Headscale must be reachable via port 443, but port 80 is not required.

1. I have nothing to do with Tailscale, or Tailscale Inc. 
2. The purpose of writing this was to learn how Tailscale works.
3. I don't use Headscale myself.
